## Book Club
 Some people learn by reading, some people learn by watching and I think we all learn by doing. The point of this is repository is watch a talk, read a book, or paper collectively, and discuss learnings each week.

## Possible Books

- [A Programmers's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org/). I just started reading this book and I love it. Math can be a scary topic for many, but this book makes it applicable by providing learning math from a programmers perspective. I'd love to do this book as the first iteration of Book Club.

- [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html). This is considered to be a classic book for programming, and I believe the first book you read as a Computer Science Major at MIT. I've tried, and failed, to finish this book a few times, so having a more structured reading group/book club setting I think will be great! It's dense, and more of a textbook, but has a ton of valuable information. It's written using a lisp dialect, `Scheme`, but I believe there are also python and clojure versions. I've tried a few, but I think the clojure version could be fun!

- [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](https://www.poodr.com/). I love this book! There is a ton of valuable insight, and its written in a clear, concise tone that is easy to grock. I think everyone who writes Ruby should read this book, so this is a great candidate for Book Club!

- [99 Bottles of OOP](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles). This is a follow up to POODR, written by Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen, two of my favorite engineers. I was taught by Katrina, and took a course with Sandi years ago, and they are both excellent teachers. I haven't read this yet, but if its anything like POODR I am sure it is amazing.

- [Understanding Computation](https://computationbook.com). This is a book about computation theory, with explanations written in Ruby instead of mathematical notation.

- [Refactoring (second edition)](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html). This covers seventy refactoring approaches, the motivation for doing them, and the mechanics of how to do them safely. Newly revised with JavaScript examples!

- [Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer). This classic book "cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core process."

- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882). Another one of those classic, foundational books, Clean Code covers the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean, maintainable code. 

## Possible Talks
- TBD

## Possible Papers
- TBD

## Format
- Read a chapter--or two--each week, then meet for 45 minutes to an hour to discuss. Many of these books have `example problems` so we can discuss different implementations, and do refactorings each week!
- This repo will provide a directory for each book, with example problems and learnings from each chapter.
